Hello! Welcome to GrapeJuice, a grape localization pipeline designed for automated harvesting. *This project is in progress!*

## Overview

GrapeJuice proposes a localization system for grape bunches to support robotic harvesting. The main objective is to localize cutting points and estimate the pose of grape bunches to provide waypoints to a robotic manipulator.

## Features

- Localization of grape bunches
- Estimation of cutting points
- Pose estimation for robotic manipulation
- Generalizable to almost all fruits with labeled data

## Status

This is an ongoing project. We hope to test on the Fetch robot by Summer 2024!
